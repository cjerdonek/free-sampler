<h1>About</h1> <p> Quick Sampler is an open-source web application for efficiently and transparently choosing items at random from a collection. </p><p> It does this by running the SHA-256 pseudo-random sampling algorithm described publicly in 2011 by Ronald L. Rivest. The application can be used for things like selecting precincts at random for a post-election manual audit. </p><p> For more information about Quick Sampler and Rivest's algorithm, including the source code for this application, visit the Quick Sampler <a href="https://github.com/cjerdonek/quick-sampler">project website</a> on GitHub. </p><p> If you have a suggestion or want to report a problem, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/cjerdonek/quick-sampler/issues">issue tracker</a>.
