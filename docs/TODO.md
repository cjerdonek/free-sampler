TODO
====

* Get tests working on Travis.
* Add an About page with information about the algorithm, author,
  that the software is open source and on github, etc
* Add an end-to-end test.
* Add a "test" option that uses the test cases (and should tests
  run automatically when starting up?).
* Expose a debug option which shows hashes.
* Expose option to set lowest number (and display highest number next to it)
* Add info about Bower dependencies to README.
* Automate keeping the version number in synch across bower.json,
  package.json, and in the page footer.  Can this be a Grunt task?
* Simplify or automate deploying a new gh-pages version.
* Include "min" attribute in form-input directive only when input
  type is "number".
