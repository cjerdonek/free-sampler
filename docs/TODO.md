TODO
====

* Validate while typing and not just on submit
* Turn the keyup to blur.
* Make sure that "tabbing" into a form input element does not cause an error.
* Expose option to set lowest number (and display highest number next to it)
* Add a "test" option that uses the test cases (and should tests
  run automatically when starting up?).
* Expose a debug option which shows hashes.
* Add info about Bower dependencies to "Technical Details" of Maintainers page.
* Finishing adding initial info to About page re: algorithm, author, that
  the software is open source and on github, etc.
* Expose JSON and text formats, too.
* Automate keeping the version number in synch across bower.json,
  package.json, and in the page footer.  Can this be a Grunt task?
* Simplify or automate deploying a new gh-pages version.
* Include "min" attribute in form-input directive only when input
  type is "number".
* Get IE test working using Sauce Labs, including with Travis:
