TODO
====

* Put the site up on GH pages.
* Handle incorrect input types using Angular, etc.
* Add instructions at the top.
* Add end-to-end tests.
* Add a "test" option that uses the test cases (and should tests
  run automatically when starting up?).
* Expose a debug option which showes hashes.
* Expose option to set lowest number (and display highest number next to it)
* Add an about page with information about the algorithm, author,
  that the software is open source and on github, etc
* Add info about Bower dependencies to README.
* Automate keeping the version number in synch across bower.json,
  package.json, and in the page footer.  Can this be a Grunt task?
