Quick Sampler
=============

This repository contains the source code for an open-source web application
called "Quick Sampler" for transparently and efficiently choosing items
at random from a collection.

The application does this by running the [SHA-256][sha-256] pseudo-random
sampling algorithm described publicly by [Ronald L. Rivest][rivest] in 2011.
You provide the number of items in the collection and a random seed,
and Quick Sampler generates the items.  The output depends only on this
information.

Quick Sampler can be used for things like selecting precincts at random
for a post-election manual audit.

The repository is hosted on GitHub [here][quick-sampler-repo].

To try the latest release, go [here][quick-sampler-app].  For bug reports
and feature requests, visit the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].


Application Features
--------------------

Some application highlights are as follows:

* Implemented using only client-side Javascript,
* Designed for use in both desktop and mobile devices,
* Tested in the latest Chrome and Firefox and in IE 10,
* Developed using [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [AngularJS][angularjs],
* Tested with automated unit tests and end-to-end tests, and
* Source code available via a permissive open source license
  ([BSD 3-clause](LICENSE)).

Since the application uses only client-side Javascript (i.e. there is no
server-side logic), the application can be deployed using only static
HTML files, etc.  This makes installing much easier if you would like
to host the application on your own servers.  Guidance for installing
locally can be found in the [Installing Locally](#installing-locally)
section.

The tests cover both the algorithm itself and the user interface.  The
algorithm itself (i.e. the output of the algorithm independent of the user
interface) is tested against the publicly available test cases in the
[`rivest-sampler-tests`][sampler-tests] repository.  All tests are set up
to run automatically using [Travis CI][travis-ci].  Different browser
versions are tested automatically from Travis using [Selenium][selenium]
on [Sauce Labs][sauce-labs].


About the Algorithm
-------------------

The Rivest sampling algorithm provides an efficient way to choose items
at random from a collection -- given a random seed supplied by the user.

The random seed can be any string of characters (e.g. letters and numbers).
For example, the random seed can be a string of digits generated by
rolling dice several times.

Since the output of the algorithm depends only on the random seed,
independent observers can check the result if they know the seed.
Moreover, because the algorithm is described publicly and is relatively
easy to implement, observers can check the result against other
implementations of the algorithm or even their own.

The reference implementation of the algorithm (written in Python), along
with a description by Rivest can be found [here][rivest-impl]
on Rivest's web site.  Another browser implementation developed by
[Philip B. Stark][stark] can be found [here][stark-app].


### Algorithm Description

This section describes the algorithm using an illustration.

Say you would like to choose from a collection of 1000 items given
the random seed `abc123`.  In actual practice, Rivest recommends using
a random seed having at least 24 digits if the seed is a decimal number
(i.e. a number using the digits 0 through 9).

To find the first number, join the seed with a comma and the number one
to get the following string:

    abc123,1

Encode this string into bytes using UTF-8 and then hash it with SHA-256
to get the following 64-digit hexadecimal integer:

    e4d62e1e48f7a7aa0e59c528bddfd96b4ff06fbff7620d7ae77e0d7e044cbf2e

Compute this integer modulo 1000 to give you an integer between 0 and 999,
which in this case is 454.  Add one to get 455.  This means that the
455th element in the collection of 1000 items is the first item.

To get the second item, apply the same process but with the number
two in place of one:

    abc123,2

In general, concatenate the random seed with the decimal representation
of the sequence number of the item you would like to pick.

If you would like to pick items without repetition and you get a repeat
of a previously picked item, apply the operation again until you get
a new item (as many times as is necessary).


Installing Locally
------------------

If you would like to host Quick Sampler on your own servers, the project's
[Releases][quick-sampler-releases] page contains pre-built releases.
Each release is a self-contained gzip file containing the directory
of files to host.  The directory contains concatenated, minified Javascript
files, all necessary third-party Javascript libraries, etc.


Development
-----------

See the [Development][development] page for information on developing
locally, including how to build the project from source and for other
information on the source code.  This page also contains information
for project maintainers.
