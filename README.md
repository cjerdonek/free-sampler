Quick Sampler
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cjerdonek/free-sampler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cjerdonek/free-sampler)

This repository contains an open source web application that lets one
run the [SHA-256][sha-256] pseudo-random sampling algorithm described
in 2011 by [Ronald L. Rivest][rivest].

The application can be used for things like selecting precincts at
random for a post-election manual audit.

To try out the latest version, go [here][free-sampler-app].

For bug reports and feature requests, visit the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].


Application Features
--------------------

The application features a user interface designed with
[Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [AngularJS][angularjs].

The application is tested using automated unit tests and end-to-end
browser tests.  In particular, the mathematical operations are
tested against the test cases in the publicly available
[`rivest-sampler-tests`][sampler-tests] repository.  Tests are
also set up to run automatically using [Travis CI][travis-ci].


About the Algorithm
-------------------

The [reference implementation][rivest-impl] of the algorithm (written in
Python), along with a description, can be found on Rivest's web site.

The algorithm provides a way to choose items from a collection given
a random seed supplied by the user.  The random seed can be any string
of characters (e.g. letters and numbers).  For example, the random seed
can be a string of digits generated by rolling dice several times.

### Algorithm Description

Here is a technical illustration of the algorithm.

Say you would like to choose from a collection of 1000 items given
the random seed `01234567890123456789`.  To choose the first item,
consider the
